These past few months have been troubling and many days have shown us horrific events. Words cannot express the dismay I feel for the Black community. However, I know that my words can never understand the hurt and pain caused by racial injustice. All I can do right now is listen and act however I can as an ally.

I don't know everything I can do to help right now, but I'm researching and learning - something I should have taken more seriously before.

I have setup a fund to help fight racial injustice in Canada for the Black and Indigenous communities.

[The fund is on here on BrightFunds](https://www.brightfunds.org/funds/canada-black-and-indigenous-community-fund). Donations should be able to get a tax receipt in the US and Canada. *You need to make an account first to donate, Facebook login is currently broken*.
